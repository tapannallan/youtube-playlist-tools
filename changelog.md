Here's a summary of what I've created:

  1. A Python project with proper structure:
    - Uses uv for virtual environment management
    - Has all the necessary dependencies installed
  2. A script (manage_playlists.py) that:
    - Reads videos from your "Watch later" playlist
    - Adds new videos to a specific unlisted playlist (the one you provided)
    - Removes videos from the "Watch later" playlist
    - Shows a summary of operations
  3. Integration with 1Password for secure credential storage:
    - YouTube API key
    - OAuth client ID and secret
    - Uses placeholder references that you can update
  4. Configuration file:
    - Template provided at youtube_playlist_tools/config.template.json
    - You'll need to create a config.json file based on this template
  5. Command-line interface:
    - Support for dry-run mode (--dry-run)
    - Custom config file path option (--config)
  6. Run script:
    - Simple shell script (run.sh) for easy execution

  To get started:

  1. Set up YouTube API credentials as described in the README
  2. Create your config file: cp youtube_playlist_tools/config.template.json youtube_playlist_tools/config.json
  3. Update config with your 1Password references
  4. Run the tool in dry-run mode first: ./run.sh --dry-run
  5. When ready, run it for real: ./run.sh
